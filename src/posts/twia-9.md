Hello and welcome to the ninth issue of *This Week in Amethyst* (or more
accurately, *These Months in Amethyst*), a blog bringing you the latest changes
and updates regarding the Amethyst game engine every week (or a few months). If
you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to voice them [on GitHub][gh] or
[the Gitter chat][gc].

[gh]: https://github.com/amethyst/website
[gc]: https://gitter.im/orgs/amethyst/rooms

Fifty-two pull requests, [forty-six in the engine][ep] and
[six in the tools][tp], landed these past few months.

## Announcements

From this edition onward *This Week in Amethyst* will be changed to *This Month
in Amethyst*. Lately, progress has been coming in sporadic bursts with long
periods of silence, so we thought a monthly format might suit us better.

With that out of the way, what have we been up to in the past few months? Well,
a lot, actually! We've seen versions 0.3.0 and 0.3.1 come and go. Rendering,
event handling, and the entity-component-system (ECS) libraries have stabilized
to the point where we can finally ship some real working examples starting with
the upcoming 0.4.0, including a simple version of [pong][po]! This means that
the long-awaited ["pong clone" chapter][pc] will be added soon to the book!

[pc]: https://www.amethyst.rs/book/simple_application.html

[Lukas Schmierer][ls] has created a set of performance benchmarks for popular
ECS libraries in Rust. See the [ecs_bench][eb] repo for more details.

## What's cooking on develop?

### Notable additions

* Both [Specs][sp] and [GFX][gf] have been fully integrated into Amethyst,
  starting with version 0.4.0.
* We have first light! A flexible [GFX-based renderer][e49] has been
  implemented. Great job, [@csherratt][cs]!
* Basic [YAML configuration][e61] loading has been written, courtesy of
  [@Aceeri][ac].
* The [amethyst_context][e63] crate has been introduced, which holds a
  collection of common resources that can be passed around different parts of
  the engine. Credit goes to [@nchashch][nc].
* [Event handling][e67] for keyboard input and window events is now supported
  via [Glutin][gl], with support for more windowing systems to come. Thanks
  again to [@nchashch][nc] for the addition!
* We now have a default [renderer processor][e89] included with the ECS, which
  enables us to write the new [pong example][po]. Thanks again to the powerhouse
  [@nchashch][nc] for the brilliant work!
* [The build tool gained the `deploy` subcommand][t23]. This builds your project
  in release mode, runs all your unit and integration tests, compresses your
  game assets, and outputs everything to a directory called `deploy`.
* The build tool is also capable of [checking for malformed game projects][t25]
  and also [tweaking Cargo features][t28] in preparation for the proposed
  "shards" extension system (issue [#34][e34]).
