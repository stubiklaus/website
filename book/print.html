<h1>The Amethyst Engine</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This project is a <em>work in progress</em> and is very incomplete. Pardon the
dust!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Howdy! This book will teach you everything you need to know about building video
games and interactive simulations with the Amethyst game engine. This engine is
written entirely in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, a safe and fast systems programming language,
and sports a clean and modern design. More correctly, though, Amethyst is
actually a suite of separate libraries and tools that collectively make up a
game engine.</p>
<p>Amethyst is free and open source software, distributed under the
<a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/blob/master/COPYING">MIT License</a>. This means that the engine is given to you at no cost and its
source code is completely yours to tinker with. The code is available on
<a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst">GitHub</a>. Contributions and feature requests are welcome!</p>
<p>This book is split into seven sections. This page is the first. The others are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> – Prepare your computer for Amethyst development.</li>
<li><a href="./simple_application.html">A Simple Application</a> – Build a basic pong game in Rust.</li>
<li>Effective Amethyst – Learn how to write complex games and applications.</li>
<li>Scripting – Jump into scripted development with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>.</li>
<li><a href="./glossary.html">Glossary</a> - Defines special terms used throughout the book.</li>
<li>Bibliography – Read the works that influenced the design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the crate-level <a href="https://www.amethyst.rs/doc/master/amethyst/">API documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Why are you building this?</h2>
<p>I've worked with a few game engines over the years, namely <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and the
<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Development Kit</a>, and both are pretty solid solutions if you want to
build a quality game. But each have their own pros and cons that you have to
weigh before using them, especially in regards to performance and scalability.</p>
<p>One engine I've always admired as a programmer but never had a chance to play
with is the <a href="http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2012/slides/Programming%20Track/Persson_Tobias_Flexible_Rendering.pdf.pdf">Bitsquid Engine</a> (now called <a href="http://stingrayengine.com/">Autodesk Stingray</a>). It's
fast, forward-thinking, highly parallel, and data-driven. It seems like a
wonderful platform for rapid prototyping. I've wanted to play around with a
Bitsquid-like engine for a while, but I couldn't find any open-source
equivalents out there. Most of those I did find stuck to outdated design
patterns and lacked the multi-core scalability I was looking for. So I set out
to write my own.</p>
<p>In short, I am writing Amethyst to scratch three of my own itches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teach myself Rust, game development, and computer graphics in their purest
form, rather than through the lens of a particular game engine.</li>
<li>Write a modular, parallel, data-oriented, and data-driven engine suited for
rapid prototyping that demands (a little) less boilerplate from the user.</li>
<li>Build a toolset that splits up the traditional &quot;mega-editor&quot; into several
<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst_tools">small but well-integrated tools</a>, adhering to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>These instructions will help you set up a working Amethyst game development
environment. Then we'll test this environment by compiling a simple &quot;Hello,
World&quot; application.</p>
<p>Amethyst should compile hassle-free on any platform properly supported by the
Rust compiler. Here are the system requirements (they're pretty modest):</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum:
<ul>
<li>CPU: 1GHz, the more cores the better</li>
<li>RAM: 512 MiB</li>
<li>HDD: 17 MiB free disk space</li>
<li>OS: Windows Vista and newer, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X</li>
<li>Rust: Nightly (1.6.0 or newer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Renderer Backends:
<ul>
<li>OpenGL 4.0 or newer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting Up</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This guide assumes you have nightly Rust and Cargo installed, and also
have a working Internet connection. Please take care of these prerequisites
first before proceeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two ways to get started working with Amethyst:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./getting_started/automatic_setup.html">Use the Amethyst CLI tool to generate a new game project</a>.</li>
<li><a href="./getting_started/manual_cargo_setup.html">Create the Cargo crate and the &quot;resources&quot; folder structure yourself</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we're just getting started, it's fastest and highly recommended to use
<a href="https://github.com/amethyst/tools/tree/master/src/cli">Amethyst CLI</a>, which is included in the <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/tools">amethyst_tools</a> crate. If
you're of the intrepid type, you may go the vanilla Cargo route if you wish.</p>
<h1>Automatic Setup Using The CLI Tool</h1>
<p>An easy way to set up Amethyst and manage your project is with the
<a href="https://github.com/amethyst/tools">amethyst_tools</a> crate. If you want to set up a game project in Cargo by
hand, follow along with <a href="./getting_started/manual_cargo_setup.html">the next section</a> instead.</p>
<p>To install the toolchain and generate a new project with the CLI tool, follow
along in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install amethyst_tools
$ amethyst new hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! You should now have a customized Cargo project set up in a directory
called &quot;hello_world&quot;. <code>cd</code> into it, and you should find the following file
structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hello_world</strong>/
<ul>
<li><strong>resources</strong>/
<ul>
<li>Lots of junk...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>src</strong>/
<ul>
<li>main.rs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cargo.toml</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You're all set! Skip forward to <a href="./getting_started/hello_world.html">section 2.3</a> to see your setup in action.</p>
<h1>Manual Setup With Cargo</h1>
<p>For those of you who prefer working with Cargo directly, like any other Rust
project, you can. However, since this is just a &quot;Hello, World&quot; program, I would
strongly recommend using the <a href="./getting_started/automatic_setup.html">Amethyst CLI tool</a> instead. It will save you
a whole lot of time.</p>
<h3>From Crates.io</h3>
<p>Create a new Rust executable project with <code>cargo new --bin hello_world</code> and add
the following lines to your &quot;Cargo.toml&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
amethyst = &quot;*&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>From Git</h3>
<p>If you don't want to get Amethyst from Crates.io, you can clone the entire SDK
from the Git repository. Once you're done, create a new Cargo project and <code>cd</code>
into it.</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst.git
$ cargo new --bin hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>In your &quot;Cargo.toml&quot; manifest, add the local <code>amethyst</code> crate and its sub-crates
as dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies.amethyst]
path = &quot;../path/to/amethyst/&quot;

[dependencies.amethyst_engine]
path = &quot;../path/to/amethyst/src/engine/&quot;

[dependencies.amethyst_renderer]
path = &quot;../path/to/amethyst/src/renderer/&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Resources Folder</h2>
<p>Every Amethyst game project must have a top-level folder called &quot;resources&quot;.
This is where your game assets are stored. In your project's root folder, create
the following folder structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>resources</strong>/
<ul>
<li><strong>entities</strong>/</li>
<li><strong>prefabs</strong>/</li>
<li>config.yml</li>
<li>input.yml</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And in the &quot;config.yml&quot; file, copy and paste this YAML configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
logging:
    file_path: &quot;hello_world.log&quot;
    output_verbosity: medium
    logging_verbosity: debug 

display:
    brightness: 1.0
    fullscreen: false
    resolution: [1024, 768]
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;input.yml&quot; file, which normally holds key binding data, can be left blank
since this is a simple application with no user interaction.</p>
<h2>All Set!</h2>
<p>Whew, we're done! Let's move on and write our first
<a href="./getting_started/hello_world.html">&quot;Hello, World&quot; program</a>.</p>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Now, we will commence our journey in writing Amethyst applications with the
obligatory &quot;Hello, World&quot; program! In your crate's &quot;main.rs&quot; file, type out or
copy and paste the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">extern crate amethyst;

use amethyst::engine::{Application, Duration, State, Trans};

struct HelloWorld;

impl State for HelloWorld {
    fn on_start(&amp;mut self) {
        println!(&quot;Game started!&quot;);
    }

    fn update(&amp;mut self, _delta: Duration) -&gt; Trans {
        println!(&quot;Hello from Amethyst!&quot;);
        Trans::Quit
    }

    fn on_stop(&amp;mut self) {
        println!(&quot;Game stopped!&quot;);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut game = Application::new(HelloWorld);
    game.run();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, compile and run the code with <code>cargo run</code>, or <code>amethyst run</code> if you
have the <a href="./getting_started/automatic_setup.html">CLI tool installed</a>.</p>
<p>You should see the following output print to your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>Game started!
Hello from Amethyst!
Game stopped!
</code></pre>
<p>If instead you see <code>error: use of unstable library feature</code> then make sure
you're using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/release-channels.html">nightly release</a> of Rust. You can use <a href="https://github.com/brson/multirust">multirust</a> to
install stable and nightly Rust side-by-side.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully written your first Amethyst application.</p>
<h2>What did I just do?</h2>
<p>Whoa, that went by too fast. Let's slow down a bit and break down this example
program into bite-sized chunks. What we did is create a basic Rust crate that
hooks into the Amethyst game engine, prints some text, and then signals to the
engine to quit.</p>
<p>Amethyst operates like a state machine. Each Amethyst application has one or
more states, each of which roughly correspond to a &quot;screen&quot; seen in a game (e.g.
main menu, loading screen, in-game, inventory menu, credits). You control when
Amethyst should switch states and what happens every time you do. In our &quot;Hello,
World&quot; example, the logic flows like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize the program.</li>
<li>Create engine with <code>HelloWorld</code> as the initial state.</li>
<li>Start the engine.
<ol>
<li>Enter the <code>HelloWorld</code> state.</li>
<li>On the first frame, print &quot;Hello from Amethyst!&quot;, and signal to the engine
to quit.</li>
<li>Leave the <code>HelloWorld</code> State.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Shut the engine down.</li>
<li>Quit the program.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Can I make a game yet?</h2>
<p>This program isn't very useful on its own, but if everything compiles correctly,
then your environment is set up correctly and you can start working on the fun
stuff! Follow along in <a href="./simple_application.html">the next section</a> to see how I implement a simple
Pong clone in Amethyst.</p>
<h1>Writing a Simple Application</h1>
<p>In this section, I'll walk you through implementing a simple 3D Pong clone using
Amethyst. You will learn a bit more about game states and also basic
entity-component-system game design and we will apply those concepts and build
a little toy game. Hopefully by the end of this section, you will have gotten
the hang of working with Amethyst.</p>
<h1>Glossary</h1>
<h2>Data-driven design</h2>
<p>Describes a program that has its logic defined largely in data rather than in
compiled code. Ideally, this would permit the user to edit their code and
resources using offline tools and have the program hot-reload the changes at
run-time for instant feedback without the need for recompilation. The bare
minimum qualification for a data-driven program is the ability to read external
content (text files, scripts, byte streams) and mutate its behavior accordingly.</p>
<h2>Data-oriented programming</h2>
<p>Not to be confused with data-driven design, data-oriented programming is a
programming paradigm, like object-oriented programming (OOP) or procedural
programming. Where OOP focuses on modeling a problem in terms of interacting
objects, and procedural programming tries to model a problem in terms of
sequential or recursive steps or procedures, data-oriented programming shifts
the focus towards the data being operated on: the data type, its memory layout,
how it will be processed. Software written in a data-oriented manner tends
toward high-throughput pipelining, modularity, separation of concerns, and
massive parallelism. If architected correctly, data-oriented software can be
very cache-friendly and easy to scale on systems with multiple cores.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Data-oriented programming does not necessarily imply that a program is
data-driven. Data-driven behavior can be implemented with any programming
approach you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Entity-component-system (ECS) model</h2>
<p>Describes a game programming design pattern invented as a reaction to the
deep-rooted problems with using <em>inheritance</em> (is-a relationship) to represent
game objects, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem">deadly diamond of death</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">god objects</a>.
The inheritance-based approach was especially common in the game industry during
the 1990's and early 2000's.</p>
<p>This alternative model makes use of <em>composition</em> (has-a relationship) instead
of inheritance to represent objects in the game world, flattening the hierarchy
and eliminating the problems above, while increasing flexibility. The holistic
ECS approach is broken into three key pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Entity</em>: Represents a single object in the game world. Has no functionality
on its own. The world owns a collection of entities (either in a flat list or
a hierarchy). Each entity has a unique identifier or name, for the sake of
ease of use.</li>
<li><em>Component</em>: A plain-old-data structure that describes a certain trait an
entity can have. Can be &quot;attached&quot; to entities to grant them certain
abilities, e.g. a <code>Light</code> component contains parameters to make an entity
glow, or a <code>Collidable</code> component can grant an entity collision detection
properties. These components <em>do not</em> have any logic. They contain only data.</li>
<li><em>System</em> (or perhaps more aptly, a <em>Processor</em>): This is where the magic
happens! Processors are centralized game engine subsystems that perform a
specific function, such as rendering, physics, audio, etc. Every frame, they
process each entity in the game world looking for components that are
relevant to them, reading their contents, and performing actions. For
example, a <code>Rendering</code> processor could search for all entities that have
<code>Light</code>, <code>Mesh</code>, or <code>Emitter</code> components and draw them to the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach could potentially be stretched to fit the model-view-controller
(MVC) paradigm popular in GUI and Web development circles: entities and
components together represent the model, and processors represent either views
(<code>Rendering</code>, <code>Audio</code>) or controllers (<code>Input</code>, <code>AI</code>, <code>Physics</code>), depending on
their purpose.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of the ECS model is the ability to rapidly prototype
a game simply by describing objects' characteristics in terms of creating
entities and attaching components to them, with very little game code involved.
And all of this data can be easily serialized or de-serialized into a
human-friendly plain text format like <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> (what we use) or <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>.</p>
